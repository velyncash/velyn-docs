# Auto Budgeting Specification

This document explains how **auto budgeting** works in Velyn.Cash.
The goal is to help users **understand their spending**, not overwhelm them.

---

## 1. Budgeting Philosophy

Velyn treats budgeting as a **support tool**, not a restriction system.

The system is designed to:
- Observe spending
- Organize information
- Provide clear insights

Users remain fully in control of their money.

---

## 2. Automatic Categorization

Transactions are automatically grouped into categories.

### Example categories
- Food & beverages
- Transportation
- Shopping
- Subscriptions
- Utilities
- Others

Categorization is intended to be **helpful, not perfect**.

---

## 3. Monthly Budget View

Users can view spending on a **monthly basis**.

### What is shown
- Total spending
- Spending per category
- Remaining balance overview

This allows users to quickly see where their money goes.

---

## 4. Budget Awareness (Not Enforcement)

Velyn does not block spending by default.

### Design approach
- No forced limits
- No penalty-based alerts
- No aggressive notifications

The goal is awareness, not pressure.

---

## 5. Visual Simplicity

Budgeting information is presented in a **clean and readable format**.

### UI focus
- Simple numbers
- Minimal charts
- Clear labels

Complex financial terminology is avoided.

---

## 6. User Adjustments (Planned)

Planned user controls include:
- Custom category edits
- Optional budget targets
- Simple alerts (optional)

All adjustments are opt-in.

---

## 7. Data Integrity

Budgeting data is derived from **actual transactions**.

- No synthetic data
- No hidden calculations
- No external assumptions

Users always see real numbers.

---

## 8. Privacy Considerations

- Budgeting data stays within the user account
- No sharing with third parties
- No public exposure of spending patterns

Privacy is respected by default.

---

## 9. Status

Auto budgeting is:
- Implemented at UI level
- Actively refined
- Expanded alongside analytics features

This specification will be updated as logic evolves.
